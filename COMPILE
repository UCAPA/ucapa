To compile this Application Programming Interface you will need to use ASIO and FFMPEG.

You can find latest version of ASIO here :
	http://think-async.com/Asio/Download
And the latest version of FFMPEG here :
	http://ffmpeg.org/download.html

Recommended versions :
	- ASIO 1.10.1 (use the standalone non-boost version)
	- FFMPEG 2.2
	
Then create a folder name "external" at the root of your API folder.
In this external directory : 
	- extract ASIO and rename it "asio".
	- extract FFMPEG and rename it "ffmpeg".

After this, you should have this directory structure :

<UCAPA>/
	-> examples/
		-> ...
	-> external/
		-> asio/
			-> some folders and files
		-> ffmpeg/
			-> some folders and files
	-> include/
		-> ...
	-> src/
		-> ...

To build the API, you have to generate the project for your IDE using CMake.  
For this, cmake >= 2.8.9 is required.
When you configure the project, you can choose between a shared build or a
static build of the API by switching the BUILD_SHARED_LIBS option. It is also
highly likely that Qt5 will not be found. Qt is not required to build the API,
however, the Navigator example needs it, so if you want to build it too, you
will need to specify the path of your Qt5 directory. For Qt5Widgets_DIR, you
will need to set the following subdirectory of Qt:
<QtDIR>/lib/cmake/Qt5Widgets
Then, you just have to build everything using your favorite IDE.

An alternative but deprecated way to build the API is to use QtCreator and
the existing projects. If you really want choose this option, you should 
choose <UCAPA>/build as build directory to avoid some annoying issues.
