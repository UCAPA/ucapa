To compile this Application Programming Interface you will need to use ASIO and FFMPEG.

You can find latest version of ASIO here :
	http://think-async.com/Asio/Download
And the latest version of FFMPEG here :
	http://ffmpeg.org/download.html

Recommended versions :
	- ASIO 1.10.1 (use the standalone non-boost version)
	- FFMPEG 32 bit 
	
Then create a folder name "external" at the root of your API folder.
In external : 
	extract ASIO and rename it "asio".
	extract FFMPEG and rename it "FFmpeg".

After this, you should have this directory structure :

<UCAPA>/
	-> examples/
		-> ...
	-> external/
		-> asio/
			-> some folders and files
		-> FFmpeg/
			-> some folders and files
	-> include/
		-> ...
	-> src/
		-> ...

To build the API with QtCreator using the existing project, we recommend to 
choose <UCAPA>/build as build directory.
Note that the API is independant of Qt, only example applications require it.
